# API.Hotels
This API is a Domain Driven Design structure base with a small touch of Brokers (:

it contians Acceptance tests (integration tests) implementation for testing api end points.

other than the broker touch, nothing special everything is following DDD starting from Infrastrucutre project, SharedKernel project and Core project till reaching the API project.

it is using relational DB with 14 tables as aggregates (respecting for DDD), the plan was to have both implementation for non-relational and relational but time wasn't a friend ):


tech/tools used while building it:

1- .Net Core 5 with all the supporting Packages for example (autofac for resolving dependecies etc...)

2- Entity Framework Core

3- swagger

4- vs19

5- SSMS20
